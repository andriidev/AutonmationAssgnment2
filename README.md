# AutonmationAssgnment 2

1. Create functionality (Done)
2. Cover the functionality with tests (Done)
3. Run the solution (Unfinished. It's not an excuse, but it was my first time when I saw Java. Definitely it's doable but need some more effort)
4. Add GitHub test execution (Done, [example](https://github.com/andriidev/AutonmationAssgnment2/runs/8293772406?check_suite_focus=true))

## How to run tests
1. Install [maven](https://github.com/andriidev/AutonmationAssgnment2/runs/8293772406?check_suite_focus=true)
2. Install [Java](https://github.com/andriidev/AutonmationAssgnment2/runs/8293772406?check_suite_focus=true) and add Environment variable the same way as for maven
3. Compile the project with 'mvn compile' (can be skipped)
4. Build a package with 'mvn package'. New build with tests will run and generate a new package
5. Use 'mvn test' for a single test run

## How to trigger tests in GitHub
1. Clone or update the project
2. Make changes in current(main) or new brunch.
3. Commit and push the changes
4. Got to the repo in GitHub and open [Actions](https://github.com/andriidev/AutonmationAssgnment2/actions)
5. You should see a new workflow run is triggered. Click on it for more details
